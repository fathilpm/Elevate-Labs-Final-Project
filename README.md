## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Understand the main causes of employee attrition and predict whether an employee is likely to leave.  
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression  
- **Tools & Libraries:**  
  - Python → Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP  
  - Power BI → Interactive dashboards  
  - ReportLab → PDF reporting

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Department-wise attrition trends  
   - Salary band distributions  
   - Promotion history vs. attrition  

2. **Modeling:**  
   - Logistic Regression classification  
   - Train-test split (80-20)  
   - Evaluation using Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

3. **Explainability (SHAP):**  
   - Feature importance analysis to understand key drivers of attrition  

4. **Visualization & Reporting:**  
   - Power BI dashboard for HR insights  
   - PDF report including confusion matrix, accuracy metrics, and suggestions

## 📈 Results
- **Model Accuracy:** ~89%  
- **Strengths:** High performance in predicting employees who stay  
- **Weaknesses:** Moderate performance in detecting employees who leave (due to class imbalance)
